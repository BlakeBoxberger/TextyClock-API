# TextyClock-API

If the user has TextyClock installed, get the localized time string by calling the method: 

```[NZ9_TextyClockFormatter getTimeString];```


To add your translation: create a fork of the GitHub repository, add your method to both the interface and implementation, and submit a pull request.
